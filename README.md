# 🚀 DevOps Cloud Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus & Grafana

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps CI/CD pipeline to **automate the build, test, and deployment** process of a Flask application using industry-standard tools like **GitHub**, **Jenkins**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Prometheus**, and **Grafana** — all hosted on a **cloud-native environment** (like GCP, AWS, or Azure).

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Automate CI/CD with Jenkins
- Containerize the application using Docker
- Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
- Monitor metrics with Prometheus
- Visualize system health using Grafana
- Ensure production-grade workflow with real-time deployment and monitoring

## 🔧 Pipeline Workflow

1. **Code Commit** – Code is pushed to GitHub
2. **CI Trigger** – Jenkins polls GitHub and triggers build
3. **Build Stage** – Jenkins builds Docker image for Flask app
4. **Test Stage** – Jenkins optionally runs unit tests
5. **Push to DockerHub** – Docker image is pushed to your Docker repository
6. **Kubernetes Deployment** – Jenkins deploys latest image to K8s cluster
7. **Monitoring** – Prometheus scrapes metrics, Grafana visualizes app health
